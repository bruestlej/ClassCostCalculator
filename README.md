🎓 Project Description: Class Costs Calculator

📋 Overview:

This Python script is a basic financial calculator designed to help students estimate the cost of their college classes at Elms College. It breaks down yearly tuition into:
- Cost per course
- Cost per skipped class session
- Cost per minute of instruction
It’s a useful tool for demonstrating the real financial impact of missing class.

🔍 What It Does:
1. Defines key academic variables:
  - Number of semesters per year
  - Number of courses per semester
  - Weeks per semester
  - Minutes per class session
  - Annual tuition cost
2. Calculates and prints:
  - 💰 Cost per course
  - ❌ Cost of skipping one class
  - ⏱️ Cost per minute of instruction
3. Encourages extra credit by modifying the calculations to include financial aid or scholarships.

🧑‍🏫 Who It's For:
- Introductory programming students learning Python basics like:
  - Variables
  - Arithmetic operations
  - String concatenation
  - Output formatting
- College students (especially at Elms College) who want to understand how their tuition translates into daily academic value.
- Instructors using relatable real-life examples to teach programming and math concepts.

🧠 Concepts Covered:
- Variable declaration and naming
- Basic math and division
- Real-world problem modeling in code
- Clear console output
